Each deferred stock unit issued in connection with the AIP Deferred Compensation Plan is credited with dividends that are converted into additional deferred stock units.  The deferred stock units reported herein reflect the additional deferred stock units credited in connection with the dividend the Company paid on 11/4/10.  Vesting of deferred stock units credited in connection with a dividend will follow the vesting of the underlying deferred stock units with respect to which such credited deferred stock units were calculated." />

The number of shares attributed to the reporting person as a Plan participant and expressed as equivalent shares has been calculated based on the closing price of Del Monte common stock on the date of the reported transaction and may change from time to time without the volition of the reporting person depending on the fair market value of Del Monte common stock and the amount of cash in the fund." />
